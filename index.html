    <p>
        So this is my dog kandi.
        <img src="img/IMG_0290.JPG" width="100%" alt="Kandi">
        <br> She is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and is just over 10 years old. <br> When I first got her she was a tiny little thing.

        Now she is showing her age. Her once jet black snout has greyed.

        <br> And she has torn the ACLs of both of her knees.
        <img src="img/IMG_20171022_101359.jpg" width="100%" alt=""> More recently she has had to have cancerous tumors removed from her sides and neck, but she has remained a happy little piggy and hopefully still has a few more good years left.
